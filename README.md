# CS201 Project
## Data Structures & Algorithms

###### This is a project for study.com's CS201 class using Java to create two small applications. 

* The first is a State's capital guessing game using two dimensional arrays and bubble sort. 
* The second is an application (using a binary search tree, hash map, and tree map) that will give the user a capital of the state he/she enters.

### Project Prompt

> Part 1: Sorting Arrays
Develop a program that asks the user to enter a capital for a U.S. state. Upon receiving the user input, the program reports whether the user input is correct. For this application, the 50 states and their capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array in order by state name. Display the current contents of the array then use a bubble sort to sort the content by capital. Next, prompt the user to enter answers for all the state capitals and then display the total correct count. The user's answer is not case-sensitive.

> Part 2: Sorting & Searching HashMap
Now revise the code to store the pairs of each state and its capital in a Map using the HashMap function. Display the content of the Map, then use the TreeMap class to sort the map while using a binary search tree for storage. Next, your program should prompt the user to enter a state and it should then display the capital for the state.
